### Brief description of the nice simple app architecture
- The app is built following the clean code paradigm and SOLID principles
- the main app architecture is MVVM with UseCases.
- UseCases that are injected in the viewmodel, are responsable for the business logic. UseCases input are injected as well for better testability.
- The main Datasource is CoinGecko api based on Retrofit implementing the NetwotkRepository contract. No data persistance is being implemented.
- The ViewModel is being injected by Hilt and it's observed as state by composable items
- The api response is wrapped in a dataclass "Resource" who propagate data and errors trough the UI
- few tests are available
